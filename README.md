# Edge extraction method based on deep learning

The deep learning algorithm was introduced into the composite imager based on microscope machine vision, and the deep learning edge extraction method based on template matching and the deep learning edge extraction method based on threshold segmentation were proposed, respectively. Experimental results show that the two edge extraction methods can exclude common interferences such as scratches, surface reflections and surface shadows, and the detection time of the deep learning edge extraction method based on template matching is 500ms, and the detection time of the deep learning edge extraction method based on threshold segmentation is 3s, and the absolute error of the final detection is controlled within 0.01 mm, which can meet the sub-pixel detection needs of complex precision workpiece sizes in the actual industry.
